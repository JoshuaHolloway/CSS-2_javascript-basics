          <p class="main-text-color", id="r2-c2-text">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host enviroment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of theses environments to provide programmatic controls over them.</p>
                            <ul class="main-text-color", id="r2-c2-text">
                                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp" class="box-3-links">Variable Declaration</a>
                                    <span id="r2-c2-text"> JavaScript variables are containters for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.</span>
                                    <span id="eg">var x;</span>
                                </li>

                                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp" class="box-3-links">Variable Assignment</a>
                                    <span id="r2-c2-text"> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.</span>
                                    <span id="eg">var x = 10;</span>
                                </li>

                                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp" class="box-3-links">Data Types</a>
                                    <span id="r2-c2-text"> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables, you need to know the data type. There are six data-types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span id="eg">true</span> or <span id="eg">false;</span> null - <span id="eg">null;</span> aka nothing; Number - <span id="eg">42;</span> or <span id="eg">3.14159;</span> String - <span id="eg">Coding Dojo Rocks!;</span> Array - <span id="eg">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span id="eg">first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'</span> </span>

                                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp" class="box-3-links">Conditionals</a>
                                    <span id="r2-c2-text"> When you write code, you want to perform different actions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span id="eg">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span id="eg">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test if the first condition is false - <span id="eg">else</span> we execute the block of code.</span>

                                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp" class="box-3-links">Loops</a>
                                    <span id="r2-c2-text">There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing; they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop.</span>

                                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp" class="box-3-links">Function</a>
                                    <span id="r2-c2-text">Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; net we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again.</span>
